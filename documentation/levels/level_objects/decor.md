# @decor

A generic dynamic object without its own dedicated logic.

## Name Structure

```
@decor TYPE
```

## Arguments

| Name   | Description                                                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TYPE` | The type of decor. Used to determine its model and properties. |

## Notes

Decor objects are useful since they allow simple, pre-defined object
configurations to be easily reused without the need for object-specific code.

If a decor object has collision then it is grabbable, fizzlable, and affected by
physics. Fizzlable objects can be destroyed when they touch
[fizzlers](./fizzler.md) or fall out of bounds.

Decor objects can play a sound, which emits from their 3D position in the world
and attenuates with distance.

All properties of decor objects are determined using their type. Valid decor
type names are:

| Type                | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CYLINDER`          | Test object. Unused. Has collision.                                                  |
| `RADIO`             | Plays "Still Alive" jazz arrangement. Has collision.                                 |
| `CUBE`              | A weighted storage cube. Has collision. Respawns when destroyed.                     |
