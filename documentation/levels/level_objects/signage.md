## Arguments

| `TEST_CHAMBER_NUMBER` | The number of the test chamber to display on the sign, along with its associated warning images |

## Notes

Signage is unlit by default. It can be activated using the
[activate_signage](../cutscenes/activate_signage.md)
[cutscene](../cutscenes/README.md) step.

Due to the way they are rendered (by dynamically modifying the model's texture
coordinates), only one unique sign can be drawn - and therefore on screen - at a
time. Placing more than one will cause them both to appear as whichever was
processed last.
