player the portal gun.

## Name Structure

```
@pedestal
```

## Notes

Pedestals can be instructed to rotate, fire a portal, or hide by using
[cutscenes](../cutscenes/README.md).

The player will be given the portal gun when the pedestal becomes hidden. If
they do not have the portal gun already, they will receive the blue portal gun.
Otherwise, they will receive the fully upgraded (blue and orange) portal gun.
