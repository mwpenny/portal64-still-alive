# Game Asset Pipeline

Most game assets are sourced from the original game's files. Content unique to
Portal 64 is created using tools such as Blender. In either case, assets need
to be converted into N64-friendly formats which can be efficiently used by the
game at runtime.

The steps of this conversion process are collectively referred to as the
_asset pipeline_. See the pages below for details on how specific asset types
are extracted/converted.
